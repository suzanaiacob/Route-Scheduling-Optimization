# Route Shceduling Optimization

This is an optimization project using location data to schedule transportation routes.

This project was completed aliongside my MIT colleagues using real data from a logistics company. The goal was to schedule optimal transportation routes which reach a series of clients and arrive at the final destination according to pre-defined constraints (e.g. specific arrival and departure times).
